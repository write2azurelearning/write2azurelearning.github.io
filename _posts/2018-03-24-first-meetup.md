The first data science meet in Kolkata was a success. A lot of participants from different work background such as Machine Learning, ETL, Deep Learning participated. We discussed couple of topics around NLP and Algorithmic Transparency.           

**Rajneesh Tiwari** presented his recent Kaggle adventures and approaches for the recently held `Toxic Comment Challenge`.             

**Suvayu Ali**, a former experimental particle physicist from CERN talked about `explainability of algorithms` and dealing with biases inherent to the algorithms. He also spoke about state of algorithms being used by particle physics community in general.
